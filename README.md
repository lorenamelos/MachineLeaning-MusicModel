# Machine Learning Music Model

<strong> Music Model </strong>

Predicting the kind of music people like.

This is a very simple model, my first one, and it was created while I was taking my first ML tutorial from Youtube:

-- Python Machine Learning Tutorial (Data Science) -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0

The comments were made from his teachings, so I could understand better and also consult this document later when needed.

This is also my first Jupyter Notebook.
