# Machine Learning Music Model

<strong> Music Model </strong>

Predicting the kind of music people like.

This is a very simple model, my first one, and it was created while I was taking my first ML tutorial from Youtube:

-- Python Machine Learning Tutorial (Data Science) -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0

## Details

1. The comments were made from his teachings, so I could understand better and also consult this document later when needed.
2. All the archives needed were uploaded, but you can find the tutorial and do it by yourself clicking at the youtube link provided above. 
3. You can check this work at Kaggle as well, making a copy nd trying to edit or run by yourself:

This is my first Jupyter Notebook and I hope it helps anyone who is a newbie in this ML world. 

Thank you!
